# EfficientMedSubsetDRL

This repository contains a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) project aimed at selecting an optimal subset from medical datasets for various applications. This approach helps reduce data volume while preserving machine learning accuracy and enhancing medical data analysis.

## Features:
- Utilizes Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithms for subset selection.
- Optimizes subsets to reduce processing costs while maintaining accuracy.
- Special focus on medical data and related applications.

## Applications:
- Efficient analysis of medical datasets.
- Accelerating machine learning processes on large-scale data.
- Reducing noise and irrelevant data in medical analytics.

### Unziping raw data
- Requirement of "format_dataset.py"
```bash
!unzip /<your_drive_Path>/MIMIC/mimic_cxr-IV.zip -d /<Path_to_your_directory>/train_images_folder
```
